## Project Description

This project is a **.NET API** built using the **SUFA (Service Unit Function Architecture)** pattern together with the **REPR workflow** (Request → Endpoint → Response).

### Key Benefits
- Clear separation of responsibilities
- Highly testable service units
- Predictable endpoint flow
- Low coupling and easy feature scaling
- Readable, maintainable architecture

This structure is ideal for scalable APIs, internal platforms, and microservice-style workloads.
